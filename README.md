# Lubricentro M&C Frontend

## Setup

The first step is to have running the [backend server](https://github.com/MatiasAdrian4/lubricentro_myc "backend server").
Once that is done, the [lmyc_client folder](https://github.com/MatiasAdrian4/lubricentro_myc/tree/develop/docs/lmyc_client "lmyc_client folder") needs to be copied and pasted in the root folder.

Now yes, we can run the development server using:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server runs in http://localhost:3000.
